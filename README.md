# LSpeak

Simple and easy-to-use TCP client and server for sending and recieving messages, written in Go.
I made this mainly to get to know Go.

Coming from Java, writing this in Go was a pleasure. I know the code isn't good. I know this isn't "optimal" Go code. This is a hobby project, for learning. As of now, the project is full of out-commented code, deprecated code, lacking comments/documentation, and is not in a state where you'd want to use it.
I'll probably keep working on this until there isn't more to change or to add. Feel free to use this for whatever you would like.
