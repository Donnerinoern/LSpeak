# LSpeak

Simple and easy-to-use TCP client and server for sending and recieving messages, written in Go.
I made this mainly to get to know Go.

Coming from Java, writing this in Go was a pleasure. I know the code isn't good. I know this isn't "optimal" Go code. This is a hobby project, for learning.
I'll probably keep working on this until there isn't more to change or to add. Feel free to use this for whatever you would like.
